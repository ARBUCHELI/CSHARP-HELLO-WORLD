# PROJECT
---------

* Console Creatures
-------------------
C# can be used to make nearly anything – even creatures! Using the Console.WriteLine() command, you can print text to the console and make something like this:

 .-.
(o o)
| O |
|   |
'~~~'
 
Each part of the ghost is a line of text, using symbols like parentheses () and tildes ~. Spooky, right? These type of drawings are sometimes called ASCII art, and you can find them all 
across the internet.

The C# program is already set-up for you in the text editor. For now, you can ignore everything except the line with Console.WriteLine();. You’ll be copying and editing this command 
throughout the project.

Make sure to use double quotes (") and a semicolon (;) like so:

Console.WriteLine("This will be printed to the console!");

* Build a Creature
------------------
1.
Run the code once to see what we have to start.

You may need to use the “Save” button.


Hint
You should see some text printed to the console.

2.
Before the first Console.WriteLine() command, write a comment explaining the purpose of this program.


Hint
A comment must:

	. begin with // or

	. be surrounded by /* and */

3.
Since the ghostly head has already been created, draw the eyes: write a new Console.WriteLine() command with this text inside the parentheses:

"(o o)"
 

Hint
Make sure to use double quotes (") and an ending semicolon (;).

Console.WriteLine("(o o)");
 
4.
Draw the mouth: write another Console.WriteLine() command, this time using the text:

"| O |"
 

Hint
Make sure to use double quotes and an ending semicolon.

Console.WriteLine("| O |");
 
5.
Make the body of the ghost by using two more Console.WriteLine() commands and this text:

"|   |"
 
"'~~~'"
 

Hint
Your code should have two new lines:

Console.WriteLine("|   |");
Console.WriteLine("'~~~'");
 
6.
Name your ghost by adding another line of text below it.


Hint
Use Console.WriteLine() and use any name you want!

Console.WriteLine("Spiro the Specter");
 
7.
You’ve built your very own apparition! You can build all kinds of ghouls with this technique. Find even more inspiration in the hint.

Remember:

The backslash \ is an escape character in C#, so \" will show up as one quote in the output (") and \\ will show up as one backslash in the output (\).
Spaces matter! " (" is not the same as "(".

Hint
To create the Dancing Man, use this version of the text:

c_     ___
  \\\\__|__|__
　　 \\( o_o)
　　　 > ~  >
