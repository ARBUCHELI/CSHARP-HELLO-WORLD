/* In order to run these kinds of programs, go the the folder that contains the program and follow the steps:
    1) type cmd
    2) In cmd type >> dotnet new console
    3) That will generate a Program.cs file.  Edit that file with your code (For now.  In the future we'll find a more efficient
    way to do this.)
    4) In the terminal type dotnet run
